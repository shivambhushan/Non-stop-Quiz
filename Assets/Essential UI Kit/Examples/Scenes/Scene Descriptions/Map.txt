The Tooltip Scene shows how to create a Map with the Scroll Rect Controller.

with a ScrollRect the player can already scroll around the map itself but sometimes you want to draw attention to a certain location on the map, reveal something and make sure the player sees it etc..
With the ScrollRectController you can smoothly (easing) jump to a point on the map. It also can calculate the appropriate position to have a Rect Transform centered inside the RectTransform.

The mission list shows ExpandableListElements that show additional information when selected (and expand of course), in this case the mission parameters.
