The Tooltip Scene shows how to create a Tooltip with the Essential UI Kit: 

There are 2 Components to it: 

1. The ToolTipTarget: The object the tooltip is about. The info (Header, Text, Image) that the tooltip will display is stored here. It also determines the position of the tooltip with a target Rect Transform (whose pivot will determine the orientation relative to that target)

2. The tooltip itself. Style as you like and with the Animator Tooltip you can also animate the tooltip appearance.
