The Overview highlights the Page Controller and the Page Element. The Page Controller is there to highlight a single Element (or Page) and allow (eased) switching between them. There are a number of ways in which you can switch between Elements (Clicking on Buttons like the Arrow Images, clicking on the Index, pressing Keys (Arrows in the Example)) and you can create your own as well. The Page Controller is especially good for showing information like tips or news that canâ€™t be all fitted on one Screen.
